API Reference Node/Server
*************************

The term in3-server and in3-node are used interchangeably.

Nodes are the backend of Incubed. Each node serves RPC requests to Incubed clients. The node itself runs like a proxy for an Ethereum client (Geth, Parity, etc.), but instead of simply passing the raw response, it will add the required proof needed by the client to verify the response.

To run such a node, you need to have an Ethereum client running where you want to forward the request to. At the moment, the minimum requirement is that this client needs to support ``eth_getProof`` (see http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186).

You can create your own docker compose file/docker command using our command line descriptions below. But you can also use our tool in3-server-setup to help you through the process.

in3-server-setup tool
##########################

The in3-server-setup tool can be found both [online](https://in3-setup.slock.it) and on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/slockit/in3-server-setup).
The DockerHub version can be used to avoid relying on our online service, a full source will be released soon.

The tool can be used to generate the private key as well as the docker-compose file for use on the server.

Note: The below guide is a basic example of how to setup and in3 node, no assurances are made as to the security of the setup. Please take measures to protect your private key and server.

Setting up a server on AWS:
    1. Create an account on AWS and create a new EC2 instance
    2. Save the key and SSH into the machine with ```ssh -i "SSH_KEY.pem" user@IP```
    3. Install docker and docker-compose on the EC2 instance ```apt-get install docker docker-compose```
    4. Use scp to transfer the docker-compose file and private key, ```scp -i "SSH_KEY" FILE  user@IP:.```
    5. Run the Ethereum client, for example parity and allow it to sync
    6. Once the client is synced, run the docker-compose file with ```docker-compose up```
    7. Test the in3 node by making a request to the address
        .. code::

            curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
            --data '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"in3_nodeList", \
            "params":[],"in3":{"version": "0x2","chainId":"0x1","verification":"proof"}}' \
                <MY_NODE_URL>


    8. Consider using tools such as AWS Shield to protect your server from DOS attacks


Registering Your Own Incubed Node
##########################

If you want to participate in this network and register a node, you need to send a transaction to the registry contract, calling `registerServer(string _url, uint _props)`.

To run an Incubed node, you simply use docker-compose:

First run partiy, and allow the client to sync:
    .. code-block:: yaml

        version: '2'
        services:
        incubed-parity:
            image: parity:latest                                    # Parity image with the proof function implemented.
            command:
            - --auto-update=none                                    # Do not automatically update the client.
            - --pruning=archive 
            - --pruning-memory=30000                                # Limit storage.
            - --jsonrpc-experimental                                # Currently still needed until EIP 1186 is finalized.

Then run in3 with the below docker-compose file:
    .. code-block:: yaml

          version: '2'
                services:
                incubed-server:
                    image: slockit/in3-server:latest
                    volumes:
                    - $PWD/keys:/secure                                     # Directory where the private key is stored.
                    ports:
                    - 8500:8500/tcp                                         # Open the port 8500 to be accessed by the public.
                    command:
                    - --privateKey=/secure/myKey.json                       # Internal path to the key.
                    - --privateKeyPassphrase=dummy                          # Passphrase to unlock the key.
                    - --chain=0x1                                           # Chain (Kovan).
                    - --rpcUrl=http://incubed-parity:8545                   # URL of the Kovan client.
                    - --registry=0xFdb0eA8AB08212A1fFfDB35aFacf37C3857083ca # URL of the Incubed registry.
                    - --autoRegistry-url=http://in3.server:8500             # Check or register this node for this URL.
                    - --autoRegistry-deposit=2                              # Deposit to use when registering.
