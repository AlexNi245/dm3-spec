# Data Structure

The conversation data is stored as a data tree grouped by conversations in packets. The structure can be in a single file (e.g., export record), as a file store with multiple files (e.g., on local file system, a cloud drive, or in a decentralized storage), or as a database (e.g., as a service).

The data is structured in such a way that fast access with low overhead to specific data is possible, but retrieval of larger data packages is also efficient enough.
