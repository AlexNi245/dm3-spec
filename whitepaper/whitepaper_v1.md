# dm3 - encrypted and decentralized web3 messaging

## Abstract

## Motivation

Messaging (such as instant massages, chats, email, etc.) has become an integral part of most people's lives. Mobile devices (such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) with instant access to the Internet make it possible to be in touch with family, friends, as well as work colleagues and customers at any time.

### Email

In the early days of the Internet, email became a critical killer application. Communication was (then as unfortunately still often today) unencrypted. But the email protocols were designed in such a way that sufficient decentralization was possible, since each user could decide for himself which provider to use or even whether to host the service himself.

Besides the weak point of missing encryption (which even PGP could not solve due to lack of application), spam became more and more a big problem. Today, spam accounts for the largest share of email traffic (60-90%, source: www.verbraucherzentrale.de). This has led to spam filters on the server side (at the service provider) as well as on the client side to filter out a large part of the spam or to prevent it from being transmitted in the first place.

Another consequence of this is that large email providers only accept emails from a few other large providers, which means that it is now almost impossible to host an email service yourself, as the mails sent in this way are not accepted by the spam filters of the large providers (see https://lmy.de/GgB0J).

### SMS

After 1990 SMS was developed, which made it possible to send short text messages between especially cell phones (device-2-device communication). Despite the rather high price and the drastic limitation of the length (160 characters), the short messages became very popular. Short messages are transmitted unencrypted from the sender's device to the service provider and from there to the recipient. End-to-end encryption is not provided.
