# dm3 - encrypted and decentralized web3 messaging

## Motivation

Messaging (such as instant massages, chats, email, etc.) has become an integral part of most people's lives. Mobile devices (such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) with instant access to the Internet make it possible to be in touch with family, friends, as well as work colleagues and customers at any time.

### Email

In the early days of the Internet, email became a critical killer application. Communication was (then as unfortunately still often today) unencrypted. But the email protocols were designed in such a way that sufficient decentralization was possible, since each user could decide for himself which provider to use or even whether to host the service himself.

Besides the weak point of missing encryption (which even PGP could not solve due to lack of application), spam became more and more a big problem. Today, spam accounts for the largest share of email traffic (60-90%, source: www.verbraucherzentrale.de). This has led to spam filters on the server side (at the service provider) as well as on the client side to filter out a large part of the spam or to prevent it from being transmitted in the first place.

Another consequence of this is that large email providers only accept emails from a few other large providers, which means that it is now almost impossible to host an email service yourself, as the mails sent in this way are not accepted by the spam filters of the large providers (see https://lmy.de/GgB0J).

### SMS

After 1990 SMS was developed, which made it possible to send short text messages between especially cell phones (device-2-device communication). Despite the rather high price and the drastic limitation of the length (160 characters), the short messages became very popular. Short messages are transmitted unencrypted from the sender's device to the service provider and from there to the recipient. End-to-end encryption is not provided.

### Web2 Approaches

In the late 1990s, instant messaging services emerged that made it possible to send direct messages from computer to computer. With the breakthrough of the iPhone and other smartphones at the end of the 2000s and messagers such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram and many others, these largely replaced SMS, not least because it was possible to send short messages free of charge.

Even though today most messengers promise end-to-end encryption for message transmission, in some cases the encryption may be lifted, e.g. when messages are to be checked for offensive content based on a report of suspicion.
Although most messengers today have a very similar feature set, cross-platform communication is not possible because each messenger maintains its own community and keeps data in its own silos. Interoperability is currently not possible, although this would be very desirable from the user's point of view.
Legislative initiatives such as the planned "Digital Markets Act" of the EU as well as various national drafts aim to make such interactions between users of the different platforms possible in the future. The challenge, however, is that the various solutions have each developed their own protocols (with a different focus on security and privacy, for example) and store user data in their individual data centers.

What these solutions also have in common is that they are centralized services. Communication always takes place over the servers of the respective service, just as the data (e.g., chat histories, but also metadata such as connection data) is managed by the service providers. In some cases, users have to make far-reaching concessions regarding their sovereignty (e.g., sharing of contact information, ...).

Often a certain messenger has become established as a quasi-standard in a certain region or user group (e.g. WhatsApp in Europe, WeChat in China, Facebook Messenger in U.S., ...). This then leads to the fact that one must also be registered with this service in order to communicate with friends and acquaintances, since they often use the most common messenger and rarely select the messenger based on its technical performance but rather on the network effect in their circle of acquaintances.
